Your walking, mining and crafting will be slow at the begining, so you'll have real reason to upgrade armor for walking speed and steel axe for mining speed.
Since you'll have both, your speeds should be standard.
+ Now you need armor to see quickbar and minimap
+ Now you need modular armor or later to see shortcut bar

Other mods recommended with this mod for even more immersivity (not required):
- [no hand crafting](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/NoHandCrafting)
- [Hardcore Start](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HardcoreStart)
!!! if you want to combine it with no hand crafting, you have to choose which initial power source you would like *!!!AFTER!!!* ship crash intro, otherwise hardcore start will empty your inventory even with mandatory tools of "no hand crafting" mod
