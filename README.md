Mod intended to raise immersivity and reward of using tools and automations.
Your running speed will be slower without heavy armor and even more without any armor.
Your crafting speed and mining speed will be very slow until steel-axe tech researched.

Other mods recommended with this mod for even more immersivity (not required):
- no hand crafting
- light cone
- flashlight on off
- Longer days and nights
- realistic power
